  description: This poison pill controller is using an alternate mechanism for a node in a cluster to detect its health status and take actions to remediate itself in case of a failure. While not all remediation events can result in the node returning to a healthy state, the proposal does allow surviving parts of the cluster to assume the node has reached a safe state so that itâ€™s workloads can be automatically recovered.
